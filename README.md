## Discrete Structures and Task Manager
Welcome to the Discrete Structures and Task Manager repository! This repository contains implementations of Discrete Structures concepts and a Task Manager application in C++/Python and Prolog, respectively.

## Contents
Boolean Algebra: Implementation of Boolean algebra operations in C++.
Propositional Logic: Implementation of propositional logic operations in C++.
Set Card Game: Implementation of the Set card game in C++.
Task Manager: Implementation of a Task Manager application in Prolog.

## Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding Discrete Structures concepts such as Boolean algebra, propositional logic, and set card games, along with a practical application of a Task Manager developed in Prolog.

## Boolean Algebra and Propositional Logic
The Boolean Algebra and Propositional Logic implementations provide examples of fundamental operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, along with truth tables and logical equivalence checks.

## Set Card Game
The Set Card Game implementation demonstrates the basic mechanics of the popular card game Set, including card representation, set identification, and game logic.

## Task Manager
The Task Manager application in Prolog allows users to manage tasks by adding, removing, and querying task information based on various criteria.

## Usage
Feel free to explore each directory to understand the implementations better. You can run the code examples provided in each directory to see how they work. Additionally, you can use these implementations as a reference while learning or teaching Discrete Structures concepts and Prolog programming.
